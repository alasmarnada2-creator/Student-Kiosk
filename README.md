The website allows students to explore different libraries, view available products, and find contact information easily.

# Technologies Used
- ASP.NET MVC  
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- JavaScript  

# Features
- Display libraries and their details using a modern card-based design  
- Search and filter libraries by products  
- User login with role selection (Student or Library Owner)  
- Library detail pages with product listings and descriptions  

#About
This project was developed as part of my **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science** at **Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (2025)**.
